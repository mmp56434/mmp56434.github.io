        <li><strong>Seven Card Stud:</strong>Players receive seven cards, and the goal is to form the best five-card hand. Betting rounds follow each card dealt.</li>
        <li><strong>Five Card Draw:</strong>Each player is dealt five private cards, and they can exchange some or all of them for new cards in an attempt to improve their hand.</li>
        <li><strong>Razz:</strong>A lowball variant where the goal is to have the lowest possible hand. Straights and flushes don't count, and Aces are low.</li>
